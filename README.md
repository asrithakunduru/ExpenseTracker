The Expense Tracker app helps you manage your spending easily with a secure login and registration system via Firebase. You can view and add expenses through a simple interface, categorizing them into Food, Transportation, and Entertainment. The app dynamically updates the total expenses, helping you stay on top of your finances. Fragments are used to display different parts of the app's UI, such as the expense list and the add expense dialog, based on user interactions. The bottom navigation bar lets users switch between these fragments or open the add expense dialog. Additionally, the top right corner menu options include logout and exit functionalities.
